# Are College Football Games Really Getting Wilder? (2002–2024)

Using 20+ seasons of game-level results, I tested whether scoring has climbed and which programs dominated.

## Scoring Trend

**What to notice:** Average total points per game show a long-run rise, with inflection near the 2014 CFP launch and the 2020 anomaly.

## Dominance Since 2002

**What to notice:** A small set of teams maintain the highest long-run win rates. A minimum-games threshold (150+) keeps rankings fair.

**Data:** Kaggle box scores (2002–2024)  
**Tools:** Tableau (visuals), Python/pandas (prep)
